# ATM-Simulation
This is a simple ATM simulation program implemented in C++. The program mimics the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) where users can perform various banking operations such as checking their account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds.


Features----->
PIN Creation and Verification: Users can create a new personal identification number (PIN) during their first interaction with the ATM. The program ensures that the entered PIN is correctly verified before granting access to the account.

Account Balance: Users can check their account balance at any time, allowing them to keep track of their available funds.

Deposit and Withdrawal: The program enables users to deposit money into their account and withdraw funds as needed. Withdrawals are processed if the account has sufficient balance.

Error Handling and Security: Basic error handling is implemented to guide users through the process, and the program includes a simple card blocking mechanism after multiple failed PIN attempts to enhance security.

Getting Started----->
To use the ATM Simulation program, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable and follow the on-screen instructions.
The program provides an intuitive menu-driven interface, guiding users through each step of the process.

Prerequisites---->
To run this program, you need:
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks)
Windows operating system (for using the windows.h library)
